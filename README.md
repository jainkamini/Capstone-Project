# Capstone-Project
# MovieCollection

Here is a fully functional app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.


# Features
With the app, you can:

Discover the most popular, the Top rated and Now palying or upcoming Movies and also find Similar Movies
Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
Watch trailers
Read reviews
Share Movie trailer
There is a home screen widget which shows the upcoming movies 

# How to Work with the Source
This app uses The Movie Database API to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to: gradle.properties
Movie API : Add an api key for the movie in the gradle.properties with the name 

MyMovieApiKey= "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

Analitycs: Add your id in the track_app.xml

  <string name="ga_trackingId">UA-xxxxx-2</string>
